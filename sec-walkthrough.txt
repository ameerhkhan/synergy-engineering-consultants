This folder will serve as the guideline/walkthrough for this project.

About the project,
------------------
This project is mainly a website for a consultancy firm that deals with Electrical Consultation for small
and large projects.
This website will also be used to develop a comprehensive software for the construction/consultation industry.

The Website will have the following apps,
1 - Main page/ Landing Page app which will have all the about us and team and contact form.
2 - Projects Page with an index view of all the projects and detailed views of every project when selected.
3 - Beginnings of the consultation software.
4 - Maybe a blog related to Engineering.
5 - Customer Relationship Manager software based on Django.

This project will be based on Django and styling will be done via Bootstrap.
Virtual Environment for this project --> djangoml

From the start again,
    > conda activate djangoml
    > django-admin startproject se_consultants
    > cd se_consultants
    > python manage.py runserver
    > python manage.py startapp homepage

HOMEPAGE:
=------->
Now we will design the homepage/mainpage/landing page with the required html files.
The database for this app will contain, the messages that will be received via the page.

    ~ Create and edit homepage/views.py to include the views.
    ~ Create and edit homepage/urls.py to include the url of the the view you just created.
    ~ Edit se_consultants/urls.py to include our app into that.

Now we will be creating models for our contact page basically which will have the following fields.
    - Name
    - Contact No.
    - Email
    - Message

Now we need to tell our project that this homepage is installed.
We will do this by editing INSTALLED_APPS list present in se_consultants/settings.py and add,
    ~ homepage.apps.HomepageConfig.

Now we will make the migrations and then migrate.
makemigrations command is used to tell Django that we have made some changes to MODELS.
    > python manage.py makemigrations homepage.
Check your new schema,
    > python manage.py sqlmigrate homepage 0001
Check your app via,
    > python manage.py check
And now run the following command to create those tables in your database.
    > python manage.py migrate

Now always remember the three steps while making model changes,
    * Change your models. (in models.py)
    * Run --> python manage.py makemigrations (to create migrations for those changes.)
    * Run --> python manage.py migrate (to apply those changes.)

Now we will make our form.


COLORS:
Main colors to be used at our own discretion,
rgb(240, 8, 8) --> A form of Red.
#323638 ---------> A form of grey.
#111 ------------> A form of black.
background: rgb(243, 242, 203);

Now we will make another app named 'Projects' which will showcase all of the projects that are or have been
worked upon.
The model will have the following parameters.

- Name of Project
- Name of client
- Work type
- Completion status
- picture
Add the projects using the Django shell,

To access the Django shell, use,

"""
    > python manage.py shell
"""

Following is a list of command used in the shell,
    :::>><<:::
    > from projects.models import Projects
    > p1 = Projects(
    ... project_name='My First Project',
    ... client='A web development Project',
    ... work_type='Django',
    ... completion_status='Unconfirmed',
    ... project_banner='images/project1.png'
    ... )
    > p1.save()
    :::>><<:::

Now things left to do,
- Projects page css to match the theme. x
- Projects detail page finishing. x
- Footer finishing. x
